## Summary

A simple to-do application. This project was one of my assignments in the Software Development Mastermind Group. Athough it seems initially very easy to construct, I found this project very challenging. There were many things to consider for implenetation. For example, just configuring the delete button caused me many problems. Also, I realized how deficient are my skills/knowledge of CSS. Nevertheless, I found the exprience I gained invaluable and look forward to working on the next project!!:-)
